"""You have two score values: score 1 and score 2. 
When score1 exceeds score2, output the message "player1 wins". 
When score2 exceeds score1, output that  "player2 wins". 
In each case, the variables player1Wins, player1Losses, player2Wins, and/or player2Losses, are incremented when appropriate.
Finally, in the event of a tie, the message "tie" is printed and the variable tieCount is incremented instead.
